# Dispute Resolution Manager ‚Ä¢‚Å† Data Analyst ‚Ä¢ SQL, Python, Power BI & Looker Studio ‚Ä¢ Data-Driven Insights & Strategy

## About
Hey there! üëã Imagine going from a total Excel newbie in 2019 to being the go-to person for data insights, scripting, and dashboard wizardry. That's my story!

Back in the day, my adventure began in an unexpected role: being the bridge between my team and the PMO company on a project that's been my world ever since. Starting with Pipefy, I was initially just trying to make sense of reports and Google Sheets. It was like learning a new language, but guess what? I got hooked on the power of data.

Fast forward a bit, and there I was, venturing into the land of dashboards. Google Looker Studio became my first ally since Power BI and Google Sheets weren‚Äôt on speaking terms yet. Crafting those initial dashboards was no walk in the park, especially in a company where data wasn't the main actor on stage. Yet, I was determined to spotlight how crucial data could be for our decisions. Today, those dashboards aren‚Äôt just tools; they‚Äôre essentials, relied upon by top brass and key stakeholders alike in the projects I‚Äôm passionate about.

Emboldened by the success of my dashboard crusades, I introduced Power BI to our toolkit, marking a new chapter in our data-driven narrative. And because I can't help but dive deeper, I'm now expanding my arsenal with Python, SQL, and more. It's like I've found the secret passage to the treasure trove of data analytics, and there's no turning back.

So, what's in my utility belt? üõ†Ô∏è

- **Data Storytelling:** From untangling the mysteries of Pipefy reports to mastering the art of dashboard creation, I turn data into compelling narratives that drive action.

- **Dashboard Alchemy:** I transform raw data into gold‚Äîvisual, impactful, and indispensable tools for decision-making. My dashboards don't just exist; they make a difference.

- **Trailblazing:** In a realm where data wasn‚Äôt king, I championed its cause, integrating Power BI and pioneering analytics practices that have become foundational to our business strategy.

- **Continuous Learner and Innovator:** Every day is a quest for knowledge, whether it's mastering Python, or unraveling the secrets of SQL. My journey is about pushing boundaries and elevating our data game.

From a novice in the art of Excel to a maestro in the symphony of data analytics, my journey is a testament to the power of curiosity, determination, and the transformative potential of data. Ready to join me on this adventure?

Human resources dashboard of a logistics company (Klog), created during the PBI Week event.

#### Context and Overview

- Comprehensive overview of hiring and terminations between 2002 and 2020
- Short-term termination rate analysis (if no more than 60 days passed between hiring and termination), requested by the HR manager
- Year-by-year updated turnover analysis

#### Skills and Approach

- ETL on Excel spreadsheets
- Simple data modelling and DAX
- Slicers and parameters within visuals for multiple combinations
- DataViz with Figma

#### Insights and Perceptions

Taking a closer look at the turnover rate, we realize that age group doesn't significantly impact this KPI, as it doesn't vary much from one age group to another. However, if we examine by position, it becomes apparent that assistants have a hiring issue that deserves attention: not only is their turnover higher, but they also represent a larger portion of the rate of bad hires (we have a lot of turnover because a greater number of people resign within less than 60 days). A good insight in this regard might be to implement a more rigorous selection process for this position.

Sales dashboard for PBIDist Company, created during the PBI Week event.

#### Context and Overview

- Brief company overview during 2019 and 2020
- Treemap for in depth analysis of company revenue
- Top influencers chart

#### Skills and Approach

- ETL on Excel spreadsheets grouped by folder
- Simple data modelling and DAX
- Tooltip with URL images
- DataViz with Figma

#### Insights and Perceptions

Overall, by examining the revenue, gross margin, and invoices issued indicators, we observed a considerable increase in the number of invoices from one year to the next. This trend suggests a reduction in the average ticket size (there were more transactions, but with smaller quantities per sale, resulting in a lower value per invoice issued). Ultimately, revenue went up, indicating that this strategy might have worked.

It's also worth noting that wheat flour was sold much more than other products individually, as there was a 224% increase in the issuance of invoices compared to last year.

Another point of analysis is the month of October, where a significant decline was noted. While this drop didn‚Äôt appear significant when looking at the sales team‚Äôs performance, a closer examination of wheat flour sales revealed a notable disparity in revenue between 2020 and 2019.
